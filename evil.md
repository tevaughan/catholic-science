With regard to the nature of evil, it should be observed that evil is of three
kinds â€” physical, moral, and metaphysical.

 1. Physical evil includes all that causes harm to man, whether by bodily
    injury, by thwarting his natural desires, or by preventing the full
    development of his powers, either in the order of nature directly, or
    through the various social conditions under which mankind naturally exists.
    Physical evils directly due to nature are sickness, accident, death, etc.
    Poverty, oppression, and some forms of disease are instances of evil
    arising from imperfect social organization. Mental suffering, such as
    anxiety, disappointment, and remorse, and the limitation of intelligence
    which prevents human beings from attaining to the full comprehension of
    their environment, are congenital forms of evil; each vary in character and
    degree according to natural disposition and social circumstances.

 2. By moral evil are understood the deviation of human volition from the
    prescriptions of the moral order and the action which results from that
    deviation. Such action, when it proceeds solely from ignorance, is not to
    be classed as moral evil, which is properly restricted to the motions of
    will towards ends of which the conscience disapproves. The extent of moral
    evil is not limited to the circumstances of life in the natural order, but
    includes also the sphere of religion, by which man's welfare is affected
    in the supernatural order, and the precepts of which, as depending
    ultimately upon the will of God, are of the strictest possible obligation
    (see SIN).  The obligation to moral action in the natural order is,
    moreover, generally believed to depend on the motives supplied by religion;
    and it is at least doubtful whether it is possible for moral obligation to
    exist at all apart from a supernatural sanction.
